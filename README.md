# week6-week7-FHIN-got-db-auth

## Installation Guide
- clone repo
- npm i
- add .env(SECRET=ahifusnf7jrs343) and config.env(DB_URL=postgres://sjbyaxhqxajulr:624aca55754a83fc5fe748e36c3d9e2a3eff2c2c3507e9bba3c596c991d0be20@ec2-54-247-82-14.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/ddkg2afd14oh46 ) to root of folder 
- nmp start and see site up and running on localhost:4444


## User Stories
1. As a user I want to be able to visit the page without loggin-in.
2. As a user I want to be able to log-in and see user info.
3. As a user I want to be able to log-in and manipulate the table of characters.
4. As a user I want to know that my user infor is secure.
5. As a user I want to be able to log-out.

## Requirements

- Login form with 2 fields - username and password
- Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
- Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
- Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
- There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
- Website content should be stored in a database
- Include thorough tests on the back-end, testing pure functions and testing routes using Supertest. If you make external API calls, use Nock to mock the response for your tests.
- Test front-end logic, we don't expect tests on the DOM.

## None of the Stretch Goals were done

To maximise time in fulfiling the requirements (as part of our SGC from last week)

### Login form with 2 fields - username and password

### Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in

### Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username

### There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).

A Game of Thrones team builder

Learning Outcomes 

High-level concepts

- What is a database, and when should you use one?
- What is a relational database?
- What is the difference between a SQL database and a NoSQL database?
- What is a database schema? How do you design one?

Implementation and deployment

- How to set up a local instance of Postgres.
- How to set up a remote instance of Postgres (e.g. ElephantSQL).
- How to connect Node to a Postgres instance using PG.
- How to avoid security vulnerabilities (e.g. script injections).
- How to use PSQL to work with Postgres from the command line.

Testing

- How to keep your tests consistent using a test database and build script
- How to write tests for database queries
- SQL skills
- Understanding the standard query structure.
- How to retrieve information from a database.
- How to update a database table by adding, deleting or changing data.
- How to sort and filter results.
- An understanding of table joins and how to use them.
- An awareness of subqueries.


## Day 1

- Discussed project ideas

![Brainstorming](https://i.imgur.com/SXUWI5W.jpg)

- Decided on Game of Thrones database

![Wireframing](https://i.imgur.com/3BSuwHu.jpg)

- Mobbed software architecture, with config.env file, and installed our node packages as dependencies

![Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/s4mzF2F.jpg)

- Mobbed the schema using diagramdb. Started with MANY tabhttps://i.imgur.com/s4mzF2F.jpgles to try and understand the different relationships (one-to-one, on-to-many, many-to-many) But this way unnecessarily complicated. 

So we ended up with this...

## Schema

## Day 2 

- Created sql and js files in our database
- Modified sql info to better visualise clan builder

## User Journey

1. On homepage user is presented with table of Game of Thrones characters listing their name, house and weapon.
2. User is given instructions - select 3 characters to build their clan and survive Winter
3. User selects three characters using checkboxes/ radio buttons next to each row
4. User clicks submit button to lock-in their selection
5. User is returned with a response saying whether they're alive or dead. eg “A Lannister repaid their debt by taking your life”
6. Stretch - user inputs their name, if they survive a new table is shown of their team members
